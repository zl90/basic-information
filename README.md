# basic-information
A basic website built with Node.js.
Nothing fancy here, just pure Node and HTML.

## Overview
I built this simple website to get familiar with the following concepts:
- Working in the back end.
- Node.js: creating a http server.
- Node.js: serving HTML files based on http requests.
- Deploying a Node server to [Replit](https://replit.com/).
- Storing and accessing environment variables with [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

### Tech used
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

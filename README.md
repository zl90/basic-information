# basic-information

A basic website built with Node.js.
Nothing fancy here, just pure Node and HTML.

#### Note: this project has been re-written with Express.js

## Overview

I built this simple website to get familiar with the following concepts:

- Working in the back end.
- Node.js: creating a http server.
- Node.js: serving HTML files based on http requests.
- Deploying a Node server to [Replit](https://replit.com/).
- Storing and accessing environment variables with [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
- Express.js: re-writing the http server and serving html files.
